# Editor

The heart of the editor is Monaco for quite a few reasons. A great thing is that we have it configured in *sublime text* mode so should feel fairly familiar.

## Sublime

Sublime and VSCode users will feel right at home as they get to use all their favorite features as it is e.g. `Ctrl|⌘ + P` (find file), `Ctrl|⌘ + Shift + P` (find command), `Ctrl|⌘ + /` (comment uncomment code), `Ctrl|⌘ + D` (select next match) and `Ctrl|⌘ + Alt + ⇅` for column selection

## Disk Watching
> The file on disk will set you free

You can use this side by side with your favorite editor.

## Focus
No matter where you are, `esc` will always take you to the currently focused editor, so you can do what you do best, **write code**.

## Jumpy
Just press `Ctrl|⌘ + enter` and you can jump anywhere in the current editor.

## Cursor History
Your cursor history is preserved across all open files. `Ctrl|⌘ + U` and `Ctrl|⌘ + Shift + U`.

## Clipboard Ring
You can cycle paste through the stuff that you copied / cut from the IDE. `Shift + Ctrl|⌘ + V`. Don't lose your head due to a nasty cut/copy error.

## Blaster
Because why not. `Ctrl|⌘ + Alt + O` to toggle.
