# Git Support

For `git` support you need to have `git` on your system path. We basically just call out to that executable for you 🌹

## Git Reset File

Quickly go back to the last Git commited version of the file using `Alt + Ctrl|⌘ + Z`. Of course you can undo this reset with `Ctrl|⌘ + Z`.

## Git Status Gutter

New sections as green, modifications as yellow, and deletions as red dots.

We also show these in the scroll bar so you know exactly what you have touched in the file.

## Git add all, commit and push

This is what you mostly do all the time. So a handy dandy command exists for it.
