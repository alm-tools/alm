# Virtual Projects

We believe very firmly that the best experience with TypeScript is a deterministic one where you control the `tsconfig.json`. However sometimes you end up opening a `.ts` or `.js` file that is not a part of your project and you just want to poke around it. You can do that quite easily by using the [project search][project-search] to select a *Virtual Project* based on the current file.
