# Tabs
We try to be as familiar as possible and work hard to make sure that `alm` can be used to complement any of your other editors. Please note that these commands can always be searched from with [OmniSearch Command Mode][omnisearch].

* Close tab : press the `x` OR center click the tab OR `Alt + W`
* Undo close tab `Shift + Alt + W`
* GoTo Next Tab: `Alt + K`
* GoTo Previous Tab: `Alt + J`

# Jump to tab

GoTo Tab: `Ctrl|⌘ + <number>` e.g. `Ctrl|⌘ + 1` to go to the first tab. Allows you to jump to non contiguous tabs easily.

# Jump Mode

We understand that figuring out the tab number can be heard. So `Ctrl|⌘ + Shift + Enter` takes you into a jump mode.

E.g. press the `<number>` key corresponding to your desired tab. Here we press `3`

Of course you can use the arrow keys to move to *right* or *bottom*:

Of course you can drag and drop the layout to your hearts content.

# Multi Monitor
You can open the browser as many times as you want and we keep them all in sync!

We even have a handy dandy command (`Window : Duplicate`) for duplicating the current browser window :
