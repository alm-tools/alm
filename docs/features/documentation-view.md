# Documentation View

> Command: Open documentation view `Ctrl|⌘ + Shift + "`

The objective of the documentation view is to provide you some insight into the project. It automatically lists all the files in your project as soon as you open it. Files are grouped by folder (a common grouping of functionality).

> Note: Files can either be modules or global. A topic [covered here](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/project/modules.html).

Click on a file to view its documentation:

> You can think of `find` as a nice way to explore the project.

Click on any item in the documentation to open the location where it is defined:
