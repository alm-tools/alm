# TypeScript Builder
Gives in depth analysis and a dev environment for TypeScript that is: 

* easy to install
* easy to use

🌹

## Usage 
Get it: 
```
npm install tsb -g
```

Run it: 
```
tsb -p .
```

Now open it in your favorite browser (pssst `chrome`) at the URL mentioned in your console.

## Why 
* Works the same on the *server* as your local file system. Remote editing FTW!
* Heck..you can check in the IDE as a `devDependency`!
* Like cloud9 ... but on your server!
* Cause it was fun to do, and demos a lot of Tech in combination and I keep getting questions about how to do these in a neat workflow: `TypeScript`,`webpack`,`react`,`radium`.
